# Chat app 💬 using websockets (Nodejs, Express & Socket.io)

 This is a chat application using Express and Websockets. Though we could use plain websockets but we would be using a library called Socket.io - which is wrapper around Websockets, its super easy to use and provies a fallback to xhr requests until the websocket connection is established.

The frontend-ui can be based on Flexbox or grid, no external UI libraries are used, so can be modified it as per your usecase.

## What is Websocket ?

WebSockets are an alternative to HTTP communication in Web Application, they offer full-duplex communication, that is, it is, bi-directional and that means the data can flow in both ways, so it can flow from client to the server and also from server to the client.
